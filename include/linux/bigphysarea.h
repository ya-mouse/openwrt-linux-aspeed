 * This is a set of routines which allow you to reserve a large (?)
 * amount of physical memory at boot-time, which can be allocated/deallocated
 * by drivers. This memory is intended to be used for devices such as
 * video framegrabbers which need a lot of physical RAM (above the amount
 * allocated by kmalloc). This is by no means efficient or recommended;
 * to be used only in extreme circumstances.
